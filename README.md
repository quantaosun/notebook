# notebook
This is mainly for my purpose of doing molecular modelling, so there might be some Chinese inside the notebook
if you can't understand that, you could write a email to quantaosun@gmail.comï¼Œ potentially, I may be able to provide all English verison.

Many the code inside the notebooks are other people's brillant ideas which I jsut borrowed from them, I have tried to claim all possible original sources where they come from either in English or in Chinese, in most cases you can get to the original source by a url link.

The purpose of my notebooks, is similar to many others, that is to democratisize the wall of doing molecular modelling, reduce the cost of drug design and make people's life easier.

The format may be not ideal, I willcontinue to improve that part.

for the  conda_rdkit_openmm_on_google_colab_modified_by_Tao.ipynb, you may want to use it with the following two links open in your browse
