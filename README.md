# notebook

Note, for the notebook called smina docking, I just uploaded here for my convenience when I need it  since I am bad at managing files, I do not have any credit on this notebook at all, you should visit https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/using-google-colab-protein-ligand-docking-leela-sriram-dodda for its original link.

If you can't get access to run.sh and analysis pyton script when using ABFE notebook, you may want to download it here

This is mainly for my purpose of doing molecular modelling, so there might be some Chinese inside the notebook
if you can't understand that, you could write a email to quantaosun@gmail.comï¼Œ potentially, I may be able to provide all English verison.

Many the code inside the notebooks are other people's brillant ideas which I jsut borrowed from them, I have tried to claim all possible original sources where they come from either in English or in Chinese, in most cases you can get to the original source by a url link.

The purpose of my notebooks, is similar to many others, that is to democratisize the wall of doing molecular modelling, reduce the cost of drug design and make people's life easier.

The format may be not ideal, I willcontinue to improve that part.

for the  conda_rdkit_openmm_on_google_colab_modified_by_Tao.ipynb, you may want to use it with the following two links open in your browse
https://github.com/openmm/openmm/blob/master/examples/input.pdb 
http://docs.openmm.org/latest/userguide/application.html#a-first-example

for the ABFE which is to calculate the absolute free enegy of a protein and a ligand, you may want to use it with these two links open 
http://www.alchemistry.org/wiki/Absolute_Binding_Free_Energy_-_Gromacs_2016
http://www.mdtutorials.com/gmx/complex/index.html
Note that the ABFE need quite a lot computer resources, you may want to split your job into several subjobs.

for the RBFE which is to calculate the relative free energy of two ligands, you many want to use it with the links below,
